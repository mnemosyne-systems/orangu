## Benchmarking throughput (`orangu-bench`)

`orangu-bench` (`src/bin/orangu-bench/`) is a **developer tool** — a fourth
binary in the same Cargo package as `orangu`, `orangu-coordinator`, and
`orangu-server`. It is not part of the served product and has no bearing on
running a model in production; it exists to answer one question during
performance work: *how fast does token generation (decode) run, how does that
rate change as the context grows, and how fast is prompt processing
(prefill)?*

It is the HTTP-client analogue of `llama.cpp`'s `llama-bench -n` (its `tg`,
token-generation, test). Rather than embedding an inference engine, it points
at a **running OpenAI-compatible server** over HTTP and measures the tokens
per second it streams back. Because both `orangu-server` and `llama-server`
speak `POST /v1/completions` with SSE streaming, the *same* tool measures both
through the *same* path — the only way to get a genuinely apples-to-apples
comparison (in-process `llama-bench` numbers and an ad-hoc `curl` of orangu are
not comparable).

### What it measures

For each run, `orangu-bench` sends one streaming completion and times the
window **from the first streamed token to the last**. Prompt processing
(prefill) and time-to-first-token are therefore *excluded* from the reported
rate — the number is steady-state decode throughput, `(tokens - 1) /
decode_seconds`, exactly the quantity `llama-bench`'s `tg` reports. Time to
first token is printed separately (`ttft_ms`) so prefill cost is still visible.

To see how decode scales with context, it sweeps **depths**: each depth pads
the prompt with filler so generation begins at roughly that many tokens of
context, mirroring `llama-bench -d`. A flat curve across depths means decode is
context-insensitive; a curve that falls with depth means attention or KV
traffic is growing per token.

> The depth padding is approximate — it appends `~depth` filler words
> (≈ one BPE token each) rather than exact tokens, because the tool has no
> tokenizer and talks only HTTP. It is close enough to compare *slopes*
> between two engines or two builds; it is not an exact context length.

### Usage

Start the server you want to measure, then run the tool against its base URL.

```sh
# orangu-server (default port 8100): sweep decode rate across context depths
orangu-bench --url http://127.0.0.1:8100 --depths 0,512,1024,2048,3072 --gen 128

# llama-server on port 8300, identical harness (uses the OpenAI-compat endpoint)
llama-server -m model.gguf -ngl 99 --port 8300 -c 4096
orangu-bench --url http://127.0.0.1:8300 --depths 0,512,1024,2048,3072 --gen 128
```

Typical output (one row per depth):

```
orangu-bench → http://127.0.0.1:8100
   depth |   gen | ttft_ms |    n_tok |     best |        mean ± sd
-------------------------------------------------------------------
       0 |   128 |     140 |      128 |    31.20 |    31.05 ±  0.12
    1024 |   128 |     520 |      128 |    24.90 |    24.70 ±  0.18
    2048 |   128 |     980 |      128 |    20.10 |    19.95 ±  0.20
```

### Prefill mode (`--pp`) — prompt processing, not decode

`--pp` sweeps *prompt lengths* and reports **prompt-processing** throughput —
`llama-bench`'s `pp` test to the default's `tg`. Each run sends a prompt of
roughly the requested length and generates a single token, so what is timed is
prefill and nothing else.

```sh
orangu-bench --url http://127.0.0.1:8100 --pp 128,512,1024,2048
```

```
orangu-bench → http://127.0.0.1:8100
  model    unsloth/gemma-4-E2B-it-GGUF:Q4_K_M
  backend  Vulkan/AMD Radeon RX 5500M (RADV NAVI14) (Vulkan)
  gpu      card1 sclk 1700Mhz (auto)
      pp |   n_tok |  cached | prompt_ms |     best |        mean ± sd
----------------------------------------------------------------------
     256 |     288 |       0 |    6021.7 |    47.83 |    44.73 ±  3.10
    1024 |    1120 |       0 |   24037.8 |    46.59 |    44.35 ±  2.24
```

Two columns exist to keep the number honest:

- **`n_tok`** is the prompt length the *server* reported (`timings.prompt_n`),
  not the length that was asked for. The `--pp` value is only a target, since
  the tool has no tokenizer — the rate is computed from what was actually
  processed.
- **`cached`** is how much of the prompt came from the server's prefix cache
  and so never went through a forward pass. A cached prompt "prefills"
  instantly and would otherwise look like a spectacular result. Every run
  sends `cache_prompt: false`, which both `orangu-server` and `llama-server`
  honour, so this column should read `0`; if it ever climbs toward `n_tok`,
  the server ignored the flag and the row is measuring a cache lookup rather
  than prefill.

A server that reports no `timings` at all (an older `orangu-server`, or a
llama-server built without them) gets a row marked `no server timings (ttft
only)`, carrying wall-clock time-to-first-token instead. That figure includes
queueing and the first decode step, so it is not comparable with the rest — the
row says so rather than quietly printing a smaller number.

### What was measured

Every run opens with the server's model and backend (from `GET /props`) and,
on Linux with an AMD card, each GPU's current core clock and DPM mode read from
`/sys/class/drm/card*/device/`. This is not decoration: a card left at
`power_dpm_force_performance_level = auto` can idle its clock down between
requests, which moves throughput by more than the difference most benchmarks
are run to detect. A rate recorded without the device and clock state beside it
cannot be compared against one recorded later. Under `--json` the same
information is the first object emitted, tagged `"type": "env"`, so a stored
result carries its own provenance.

### Options

`orangu-bench --help`:

```text
Usage: orangu-bench [OPTIONS]

Options:
      --url <URL>          Base URL of the server [default: http://127.0.0.1:8100]
      --depths <DEPTHS>    Comma-separated context depths to sweep [default: 0]
      --pp <PP>            Prefill mode: comma-separated prompt lengths to sweep, reporting prompt-processing throughput
      --gen <N_GEN>        Number of tokens to generate per timed run [default: 128]
      --curve <CURVE>      Curve mode: ONE generation of this many tokens, decode rate bucketed by context [default: 0]
      --bucket <BUCKET>    Bucket width (in context tokens) for --curve [default: 256]
      --reps <REPS>        Repetitions per depth; the reported rate is the best run with mean±sd [default: 3]
      --no-warmup          Skip the initial warmup run
      --timeout <TIMEOUT>  Per-request timeout in seconds [default: 600]

  -V, --version            Print version
```

Notes: `--url` is the server base URL (the tool appends `/v1/completions`);
`--depths` is comma-separated (e.g. `0,512,1024,2048`); `--reps` reports the
best (fastest) run with mean ± standard deviation alongside; warmup (one short
generation) is on unless `--no-warmup`; `--json` emits one JSON object per depth
instead of the table.

### Curve mode (`--curve`) — decode scaling without prefill

The depth sweep pads the *prompt* to reach a context depth, which means a large,
slow, VRAM-heavy prefill on orangu (its multi-hundred-token prefill is
CPU-orchestrated). `--curve N` avoids that entirely: it does **one** generation
of `N` tokens, timestamps each streamed token, and reports the instantaneous
decode rate per `--bucket`-token context window. That is the cleanest way to see
decode-vs-context scaling, and it works identically against orangu-server and
llama-server.

```sh
orangu-bench --curve 3072 --bucket 256   # decode rate at ctx 0, 256, 512, …, 2816
```

```text
orangu-bench → http://127.0.0.1:8100 (curve: 3072 tokens, bucket 256)
     ctx |    tok/s
------------------
       0 |    29.29
     256 |    24.10
     512 |    23.47
     ...
```

Context position is approximated by the generated-token index (the prompt is
short). `--json` emits `{"ctx":…,"tok_per_s":…,"tokens":…}` per bucket.

### Confirm you are measuring the build you think you are

The header line

```
  server   pid 2623608 up 2s
```

is there to be checked, not skipped. When A/B-ing two builds, the **pid must
change** between the two runs and `up` must be a few seconds, not minutes.

The failure it catches is quiet and convincing. Stop the old server by process
name (`pkill -x orangu-server`) and it will miss a build you copied to another
filename — `pkill` matches the *binary's* name, not the path. The replacement
server then fails to bind the port, exits, and `orangu-bench` measures the
server that is still running: the old one. Both runs report the same numbers,
which reads as a clean "this change did nothing" result rather than as a broken
measurement. Keeping both builds named `orangu-server` in separate directories
avoids it; checking the pid proves it.

`llama-server` does not report these fields, so the line is omitted for it —
there, check the process yourself.

### Interpreting a comparison

Run the same sweep against both servers and compare **the shape of the curve**,
not just the top-of-context point. Two builds (or two engines) that start at a
similar short-context rate but diverge as depth grows differ in how their
attention / KV path scales, not in their per-token matmul — which is the
distinction that matters when deciding what to optimize. The overall
performance investigation this tool supports lives in
`doc/SERVER_ROADMAP.md`.

### Measuring kernel occupancy (register pressure), not just throughput

`orangu-bench` measures end-to-end **throughput**, which on a laptop dGPU is at
the mercy of the GPU's power state — if the core clock isn't pinned at its
maximum, two runs minutes apart are not comparable (check
`cat /sys/class/drm/card1/device/pp_dpm_sclk` and confirm the `*` is on the top
frequency). When the question is instead *why* a compute kernel is slow — its
register (VGPR) count and occupancy — there is a **clock-independent** measure:
the RADV driver's compile-time shader statistics.

```sh
# Print per-pipeline VGPR/SGPR/occupancy as RADV compiles each kernel.
# Run it through the cross-check TEST, not the server: the test builds the
# GPU backend and compiles the pipelines, and is immune to model load and to
# the occasional flaky long-lived server startup. `,nocache` forces a fresh
# compile every run (RADV otherwise serves the stats-less disk cache).
RADV_DEBUG=shaderstats,nocache \
  cargo test --bin orangu-server matmul_matches_cpu_backend_for_q4_k -- --nocapture
```

To attribute a stats block to a specific kernel, capture with the kernel's env
flag on and off (e.g. `ORANGU_Q4K_LIGHT=1` vs unset) and diff the `VGPRs:` /
`Code size:` blocks — the one that appears only with the flag on is that kernel.
`ORANGU_DUMP_SHADERS=<dir>` additionally writes each kernel's generated WGSL to
`<dir>` for inspection. This is the harness the `doc/SERVER_ROADMAP.md` Step 16
work used to settle a kernel's occupancy without trusting a throttled
throughput number.

### Requirements and caveats

- Use `temperature 0` semantics: the tool always sends `temperature: 0` so runs
  are deterministic and comparable.
- It sends both `max_tokens` (OpenAI) and `n_predict` (llama.cpp native) so a
  server honors whichever it recognizes.
- Force the GPU to a stable clock state before benchmarking, or the numbers
  reflect the governor, not the code (see `orangu-server`'s startup power-state
  advisory).
- The tool disables prompt caching (`cache_prompt: false`) so each run
  re-establishes its context rather than reusing a cached prefix.
